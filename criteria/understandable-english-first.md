## Requirements

### All codebase documentation MUST be in English.

#### Examples

* [Notify documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-manuals/wiki)

### All code MUST be in English, except where policy is machine interpreted as code.

### All bundled policy not available in English MUST have an accompanying summary in English.

### Any translation MUST be up to date with the English version and vice versa.

This applies to everything that is in a "released" state. During development, lag may occur.

### There SHOULD be no acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/non-English/domain specific terms in the codebase without an explanation preceding it or a link to an explanation.

While you should try to keep the language plain, don't be afraid to create a glossary for terms that are specific for the domain and would cause even more confusion if they were not used.

### The name of the codebase SHOULD be descriptive and free from acronyms, abbreviations, puns or organizational branding.

#### Examples

* [FixMyStreet](https://www.fixmystreet.com/)

### Documentation SHOULD aim for a lower secondary education reading level, as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.

#### Resources

* [Understanding Reading Level of the WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/Understanding/reading-level.html) with resources for evaluating the reading level of a text

#### Tools

* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) - spelling and grammar
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) - grammar
* [Hemingway text editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) - readability
* [Upgoer 5 text editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/) by Theo Sanderson, only allows 1000 most common words

### Any code, documentation or tests MAY have a translation.
