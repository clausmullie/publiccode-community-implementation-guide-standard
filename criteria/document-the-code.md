## General

### Tools

* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
* [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/)
* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* [readme.so](https://readme.so/) is a tool to create a README file

### Resources

* [How to write a README](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam.github.io/blob/master/guides/write-a-readme.md), guide from the municipality of Amsterdam.

## Requirements

### All of the functionality of the codebase, policy as well as source, MUST be described in language clearly understandable for those that understand the purpose of the code.

#### Examples

### The documentation of the codebase MUST contain a description of how to install and run the source code.

#### Examples

### The documentation of the codebase MUST contain examples demonstrating the key functionality.

#### Examples

### The documentation of the codebase SHOULD contain a high level description that is clearly understandable for a wide audience of stakeholders, like the general public and journalists.

#### Examples

* [CKAN](https://ckan.org/): "CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and use data. It powers hundreds of data portals worldwide."
* [OpenFisca description](https://openfisca.org/doc/index.html)

### The documentation of the codebase SHOULD contain a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the source code, including, if necessary, a test dataset.

#### Examples

### The documentation of the codebase SHOULD contain examples for all functionality.

#### Examples

### The documentation SHOULD describe the key components or modules of the codebase and their relationships, for example as a high level architectural diagram.

#### Examples

* [DigiTransit UI architecture](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui/blob/v2/docs/Architecture.md)
<!-- There may be some good examples in https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Software_architecture -->

### There SHOULD be continuous integration tests for the quality of the documentation.

### Including examples that make users want to immediately start using the codebase in the documentation of the codebase is OPTIONAL.

#### Examples

* [CKAN showcase implementations](https://ckan.org/showcase)
