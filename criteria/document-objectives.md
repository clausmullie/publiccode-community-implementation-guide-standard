Be on the lookout for people, organizations and initiatives with similar objectives to see if you can collaborate rather than compete.

## Requirements

### The codebase MUST contain documentation of its objectives, like a mission and goal statement, that is understandable by developers and designers so that they can use or contribute to the codebase.

#### Examples

* [Omgevingsbeleid objectives](https://github.com/Provincie-Zuid-Holland/Omgevingsbeleid-Frontend#objectives)
* [Vision and mission of Govdirectory](https://github.com/govdirectory/website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#direction)

### Codebase documentation SHOULD clearly describe the connections between policy objectives and codebase objectives.

#### Examples

### The codebase MAY contain documentation of its objectives for the general public.
