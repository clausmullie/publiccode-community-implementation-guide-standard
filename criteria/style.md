## Requirements

## Use a coherent style

### The codebase MUST use a coding or writing style guide, either the codebase community's own or an existing one referred to in the codebase.

#### Examples

* Basic guidelines: [OpenZaak](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Guidelines of a very mature project: [Git](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines)

### Contributions SHOULD pass automated tests on style.

#### Resources

* [List of linters](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters) by Hugo Martins.

<!-- When we add the one above, we should also remove it from the standard -->

### The style guide SHOULD include expectations for inline comments and documentation for non-trivial sections.

#### Examples

### Including expectations for understandable English in the style guide is OPTIONAL.
