## Requirements

### For features of a codebase that facilitate the exchange of data the codebase MUST use an open standard that meets the Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements.

### Any non-open standards used MUST be recorded clearly as such in the documentation.

### Any standard chosen for use within the codebase MUST be listed in the documentation with a link to where it is available.

#### Examples

### If no existing open standard is available, effort SHOULD be put into developing one.

### Standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over those that are not.

### Functionality using features from a standard that is not an open standard MAY be provided if necessary, but only in addition to compliant features.
