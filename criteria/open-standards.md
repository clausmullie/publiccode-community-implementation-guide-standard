## Requirements

### For features of a codebase that facilitate the exchange of data the codebase MUST use an open standard that meets the Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements.

### Any non-open standards used MUST be recorded clearly as such in the documentation.

### Any standard chosen for use within the codebase MUST be listed in the documentation with a link to where it is available.

#### Examples

### Any non-open standards chosen for use within the codebase MUST NOT hinder collaboration and reuse.

### If no existing open standard is available, effort SHOULD be put into developing one.

### Open standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over open standards that are not.

### Non-open standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over non-open standards that are not.
