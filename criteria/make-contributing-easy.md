## Requirements

### The codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that accepts suggestions from anyone.

#### Examples

* GitHub Issues like [https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues)
* [Self-hosted Gitea Issues](https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/issues)
* (add a good gitlab example)
* [Tasks in Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/)

### The codebase MUST include instructions for how to privately report security issues for responsible disclosure.

#### Examples

* [OpenZaak SECURITY](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/SECURITY.rst)
* [Verdaccio SECURITY](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

### The documentation MUST link to both the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes, for example in a README file.

In many platforms, like GitHub, GitLab, Gitea etc. these links are automatically provided in the interface. If you don't use the features of the platform, for example if you have a separate issue tracker, then you must provide these links.

### The codebase MUST have communication channels for users and developers, for example email lists.

Preferably, anyone should be able to join these and start discussing without requiring an invite or other manual intervention.

##### Video

##### Audio

#### Examples

* [CivicTech Sweden (RocketChat)](https://chat.civictech.se/home)
* [Publiccode.yml forum (GitHub discussions)](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/discussions)

### There MUST be a way to report security issues for responsible disclosure over a closed channel.

#### Examples

### The documentation MUST include instructions for how to report potentially security sensitive issues.

#### Examples

* [OpenZaak SECURITY](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/SECURITY.rst)
* [Verdaccio SECURITY](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
