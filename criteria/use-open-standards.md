# Use open standards

## Requirements

### For features of a codebase that facilitate the exchange of data the codebase MUST use an open standard that meets the Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements.

### Any non-open standards used MUST be recorded clearly as such in the documentation.

### Any standard chosen for use within the codebase MUST be listed in the documentation with a link to where it is available.

Besides making a list, consider adding badges to the repository for the standards used so that contributors immediately see shat is required for a contribution to the codebase.

#### Examples

* [Standard for Public Code](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard#standard-for-public-code) - showing both a badge in use and instructions for how to apply it.

### Any non-open standards chosen for use within the codebase MUST NOT hinder collaboration and reuse.

### If no existing open standard is available, effort SHOULD be put into developing one.

### Open standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over open standards that are not.

### Non-open standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over non-open standards that are not.
